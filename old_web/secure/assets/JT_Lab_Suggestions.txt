Hi Guys, 

The lab is the public space.  Different people may have different habits.  Some may be tolerant to noise while others may be very sensitive to noise.  Some may want to work during the day time while others want to work during nights. As a team, we want everyone to be happy and comfortable.  Of course, I believe everyone is very friendly and respective to others. However, sometimes we may unintentionally make others feel uncomfortable. Therefore, to make the lab suitable for everyone as a DEDICATED research space.  I STRONGLY suggest the following and of course, from TODAY myself will also follow the suggestions.  

1. Do not answer phones in the lab.  If you want to use phone for other purposes, please adjust it to the quiet mode. 
2. For any LONG discussions (more than 5 mins), please find a classroom or a conference room. Even for short discussions, please LOWER down your voice. 
3. Please do speak ENGLISH in the lab 

I hope your guys can understand that we have 15 people (more later) in such a small space, any noise can impact and distract others.  PLEASE consider my suggestions though I do not want to make them as hard rules.
