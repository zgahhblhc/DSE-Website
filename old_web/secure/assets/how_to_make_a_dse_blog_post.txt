How to create a blog post on the DSE website
============================================

1) ssh into one of the cse servers (e.g., black.cse.msu.edu)

2) change directory to /research/tangjili/web/blog

3) copy the file dec_1_2018.html to a new file (e.g., cp
dec_1_2018.html dec_18_2018.html) this will be the file you add the
content for your blog post

4) you can edit your newly created html file as you see fit, it will
have an example how to create the title, text, images, and references

5) now add your new blog post to the home page by opening
/research/tangjili/web/blog/assests/home.json

5a) first create a backup copy of this file (i.e., cp
/research/tangjili/web/blog/assests/home.json
/research/tangjili/web/blog/assests/home.json.bak)

5b) in this file (i.e., not the .bak version) you can add another
<li>...</li> list element similar to the ones found there already

6) You should go to www.dse.cse.msu.edu/blog to test if your blog is
listed correctly and then follow the link to ensure the page looks as
expected

7) please make sure the file
/research/tangjili/web/blog/assests/home.json and .bak version have
the permissions 664 and group 'dse', similarly for your blog html file
