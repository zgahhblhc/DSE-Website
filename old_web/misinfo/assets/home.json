Meanwhile social media users are highly connected and information can propagate quickly and easily reach a massive amount of users. However, the open and connected nature also makes it an ideal channel to spread misinformation. Addressing the information credibility problem becomes increasingly important and necessary to provide healthy, trustworthy and reliable online worlds. In this project, we examine misinformation from macro and micro perspectives and develop effective algorithms and systems to detect and intervene misinformation.<br><br><b>Current Graduate Students:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li><a href='http://www.cse.msu.edu/~karimiha'>Hamid Karimi</a></li></ul>"]
