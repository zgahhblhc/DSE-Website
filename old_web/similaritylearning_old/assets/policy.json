However, you are forbidden from sharing your solution to becopied by other students. All submitted assignments must be your own work. Students who were found copying or sharing their solution to be copied by other students will automatically receive a zero for their homework assignment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructor reserves the right to modify the course content and class schedule during the semester. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make-up for examinations can be arranged if your absence is caused by documented illness or personal emergency.
