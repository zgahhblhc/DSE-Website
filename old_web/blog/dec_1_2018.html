	As the title says, 3 parts data and 1 part algorithm design,
	these were the words of wisdom given to me when talking with
	Dr. Xindong Xu (the president of ICDM) and similar words from
	Dr. Feida Zhu (one of this year’s ICDM General Chairs), but
	perhaps this divide need some context. The final event on the
	last day was the <strong>“ICDM Panel: The Future of Data Mining –
	Frontiers, Opportunities, and Challenges”</strong>, in which Dr. Feida
	Zhu was the moderator and the expert panelists were
	Dr. Ramamohana (Rao) Kotagiri, Dr. Xindong Wu, Dr. Bhavani
	Thuraisingham, Dr. Dacheng Tao, and Dr. C. Mohan (listed from
	left to right in the above image). They discussed
	the future of data mining and answered a few questions from
	the audience, such as their thoughts on the role deep learning
	will play moving forward. However, one question that was posed
	by the moderator (Dr. Feida Zhu) was a question that related
	to the idea of whether currently today, if having a company,
	what should the balance be between focusing on
	obtaining/collecting “good” data as compared to spending more
	resources on researching new algorithm designs. Each of the
	panelists discussed their thoughts and just about everyone
	finally reasoned that both are necessary, except for
	Dr. Xindong Wu. He immediately said data is more important,
	and insisted that for both big industry along with start ups
	companies that they should be focusing on the data aspect of
	things. However, this seems to contradict the primary way of
	thought from perhaps a decade ago where everyone focused on
	developing the cutting edge algorithms (to ultimately obtain
	slightly better performance than the competition). I had
	wanted to ask the following question to the panel thereafter,
	but unfortunately they were out of time and only one other
	person was selected for a question: <strong>“If you had to assign a
	ratio between the importance of data and algorithms, what
	would it be?”</strong>, since none of the panelists included this for
	their answers previously.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	  <img id="Image1" src="images/dec_1_2018/tyler_and_xindong.jpeg"
	       style="padding: 20px;" align="right"  width="30%" />
	I waited until after the closing remarks to find seek out
	Dr. Feida Zhu, to ask his opinion on this matter, since he
	first posed the question and is the founder of Symphony
	Protocol [1]. Thereafter I asked Dr. Xindong Wu if he could
	elaborate on the comments he made during the panel
	session. This is when he mentioned the ratio given here of 3
	times the effort on data over the algorithm
	       design. <strong>Dr. Xindong Wu and I
	further discussed why in today’s world the focus must shift
	towards data.</strong> My thoughts were basically that <strong>1)</strong> essentially
	no competitor is going to share their data with you, <strong>2)</strong>
	realizing that we can be “standing on the shoulders of giants”
	~ Sir Isaac Newton, which in this context is to
	say that for the algorithm design it is quite reasonable to
	utilize the methodologies that are being developed in the top
	data mining and machine learning conferences (such as ICDM)
	and thus not requiring as much effort, since we do not need to
	start from scratch, <strong>3)</strong> if the algorithms are more openly
	shared and the data is not, it seems only logical that the
	data should be more of the focus, plus it is a race to obtain
	the data first because once it is obtained it has the
	potential to be harnessed by the owner to outperform the
	competition, and finally <strong>4)</strong> most are currently overlooking the
	fact that data collected from different cultures (i.e.,
	sources/locations) can have vastly different insights and is
	likely to struggle when attempting to utilize data collected
	in one culture that was obtained in another. In regards to the
	last point, it is believed this is likely one of the reasons
	that Google allegedly has the modified censored search engine
	designed for China, that is allegedly codenamed Dragonfly
	(which the Google CEO Sundai Pichai has reportedly commented
	that things were “exploratory”, but the project has not been
	officially confirmed [2]). This is because although Google is
	collecting vast amount of information from around the world,
	in China they have roughly only 2% of the search market [3],
	while China has roughly 18% of the world population [4].
	</p>
	<p  style="text-align:justify">
	Another key point I’m wanting to share with everyone based on
	my experience at ICDM 2018 (and other conferences) is that you
	should <strong>always be curious and willing to ask
	questions</strong>. Although for some of us it might be out of our
	comfort zone to ask a question in front of the whole room, but
	with practice, it will becomes second nature, so you might as
	well start asking now (or at least by the next time your
	attending a conference).

	  Finally, wanting to highlight that <strong>participating in the PhD
	Forum is a great opportunity</strong> to share your ongoing
	dissertation topic while obtaining great feedback from your
	peers and experts who attend the session. This year we were
	lucky to have the session “Meeting with Mentors”, which
	consisted of, Dr. Panagiotis Papapetrou Dr. Bhavani
	Thuraisingham, and Dr. Xindong Wu, who in a panel format,
	answered our questions. I had asked them the question of first
	how to balance reading papers. More specifically, in that
	sometimes we need to go deeper to understand everything on
	very relevant topics to our own, but other times we are just
	seeking a higher level understanding of the methodology and
	the direction the community is focusing in at that time (i.e.,
	finding the hot/trending topics) and furthermore, how they
	believe this changes (or perhaps needs to change) when
	transitioning from a PhD student to an Assistant Professor. If
	you’d like to hear more about their thoughts on this matter
	and also that of my own
	  advisor, <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili">Dr. Jiliang
	  Tang </a> (who I have
	discussed the same topic with), I encourage you to drop me an
	email, or if you have any other thoughts of questions; I’d be
	happy to discuss with you.
	</p>
	<p  style="text-align:justify">
	Overall, I believe my time spent at ICDM 2018 this year was
	very fruitful, especially in terms of networking with the community (both
	my fellow PhD students and senior data mining researchers).
